22/TCP - SSH port
7000/TCP Cassandra inter-node cluster communication must be open on all Cassandra nodes.
7001/TCP Cassandra SSL inter-node cluster communication must be open on all Cassandra nodes.
7199/TCP JMX monitoring port. Each agent opens a JMX connection to its local node. Note: It is not necessary to set this local port for firewall purposes.
8888/TCP OpsCenter web-based user interface. The opscenterd daemon listens on this port for HTTP requests coming directly from the browser.
8443/TCP The port on which to serve SSL traffic. The opscenterd daemon listens on this port for HTTPs requests being redirected from port 8888.
9042/TCP Cassandra Client port must be all Cassandra nodes.
9160/TCP Cassandra Client thrift port must be all Cassandra nodes.
61619/TCP OpsCenter stomp port. A port used by the Stomp service for internal communications on the OpsCenter server. Note: It is not necessary to set this local port for firewall purposes.
61620/TCP - Agent communications over Stomp. The opscenterd daemon listens on this port for TCP traffic coming from the agents. This port needs to be open on OPSCENTER Server (10.7.230.4)
