ABOUT DATASTAX ENTERPRISE EDITION

DataStax Enterprise Edition delivers a comprehensive data management layer with its unique always-on architecture that accelerates the ability of enterprises, government agencies, and systems integrators to power their exploding number of cloud applications. DSE supports cloud applications that require data distribution across datacenters and clouds, through the use of its secure, operationally simple platform that is built on Apache Cassandra.

DataStax Enterprise Edition includes
(1) DataStax Enterprise Server;
(2) OpsCenter Management Tool;
(3) DataStax Studio Developer Tool;

The DataStax Enterprise server uses Apache Cassandra for transactional
data management, Apache Spark for near-real time analytic
processing, Apache Hadoop for batch analytic processing, 
Apache Solr for enterprise search operations, and Apache TinkerPop
for graph processing.

DataStax Enterprise Edition may be used free of charge
for development purposes, however production deployments
require a subscription. For information on purchasing a
